# The Ethereals

>"Captain's log, Estimated year 2455.

	We have come across a strange large mass in orbit around Hyper Star 2533, it has vexed our scientests. I fear that I am not good enough at talking to begin describing what I see. I want to say it sorta looks like Jupiter, covered in gaseous storm clouds, but that's not the weird part. The clouds look sort of like the great mother earth's clouds, but they just cover...well the whole thing. But that's not the weird part, upon circling the planet we noticed it shined a certain way. You ever see a bubble in the light? It kinda shines like that. I shouldn't really take credit for that, our scientists were the ones that said it appears to be encased in a bubble. We're gonna visit the planet soon. It may seem rash, but I, Plutonius McBartelone fear no bubble, and my scholarly inclined crew feel just as brave. I hope to bring great discoveries. Over and out."
 
-Last transmission from the S.S. Lunamore IV

***

Following the final transmition of S.S. Lunamore IV and her crew, there was a period of mass investigation led by the Terra Gov Marine Core. At the time, war with the Lizard Folk had barely ended, and both parties were on edge at the time, fearful that the other would pull a turnaround and break the treaty. The resulting catastrophe could result in the annihalation of the other's forces, or worse, both forces at once.

Hyper Star System 2533 was promptly probed discretely for a set of years, and the lost transmission was formally brushed away as a conspiracy by TerraGov. They had erased all personal information of the late McBartelone and his bethrothed ship. Unfortunately it did not succeed. It had the opposite effect even, resulting in the boom of the adventurous venturing out to Hyper Star 2533 to investigate the incident themselves.

Regardless of it all, it failed, for the next 50 years the tale had become an urban myth, forgotten. This miserable incident was finally written off as a Captain's miserable dramatic misinterpretation of flying into a cloud of radioactive material, or worse, into a dimmed dwarf star. The people forgot, hell, even TerraGov had forgotten the tale of the missing Captain. In the end, it was simply written off as a stain on TerraGov's reputation.

That is until a TGMC warship recieved a transmission from McBartelone once more.

## Gaia

The year is 2506 in the bleak edges of the Lodossian Solar System came a visitor to the puny TerraGov Marine Warship has arrived. Or in a better sense, a traveller revealed itself to it's visitors.

A clear blotch in the stars had slowly began to tear away and a pale glistening drop of silver had began to manifest over the stars with grand incandescent arrogance. This process took many hours, but that wasn't the only visitor to the Marines. A ship had arrived, no doubt from the general direction of the slowly revealing pearl.

S.S. Lunamore V.

This was the name that escaped the lips of the onlookers in the commander's cockpit, no one could believe it. S.S. Lunamore IV, a research ship that had lost itself to the stars. A rather old and outdated ship. It came visiting the war craft and from its communication devices came a promise of an unforgettable reencounter. It was a marvelous ship. The hull that was once a dated barely functioning metal brick had it's old plating had been replaced with sleek weapons grade plastic and was fashioned into a marvelous sturdy looking tube. The thrusters which once carried arrogant men across the stars were now lacking, but in their place were a glorious collection of ropes, each blazing at the end while they span in unison to propel the cockpit. The cockpit, oh the cockpit. What was once a metal coffin fitting a crew of 5 cramped men behind a thin piece of pathetic glass had been reimagined into a beautiful 20-sided structure, each side being a flat triangular panel of an unknown crystalline structure. Each triangle glowed marvelously, each a color unlike the others, as it got closer to the bewitched men they could see that each panel had a tube growing inwards. Each tube was a marvelous light that seemed to bring unnecessary attention to the cockpit. There were those that in its glory stared too long they had to look away. And in their after image of the lights, they saw that in the center of each tube, was a humanoid figure.
