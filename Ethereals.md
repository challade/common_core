# The Ethereals

>"Captain's log, Estimated year 2455.

	We have come across a strange large mass in orbit around Hyper Star 2533, it has vexed our scientests. I fear that I am not good enough at talking to begin describing what I see. I want to say it sorta looks like Jupiter, covered in gaseous storm clouds, but that's not the weird part. The clouds look sort of like the great mother earth's clouds, but they just cover...well the whole thing. But that's not the weird part, upon circling the planet we noticed it shined a certain way. You ever see a bubble in the light? It kinda shines like that. I shouldn't really take credit for that, our scientists were the ones that said it appears to be encased in a bubble. We're gonna visit the planet soon. It may seem rash, but I, Plutonius McBartelone fear no bubble, and my scholarly inclined crew feel just as brave. I hope to bring great discoveries. Over and out."
 
-Last transmission from the S.S. Lunamore IV

***

Following the final transmition of S.S. Lunamore IV and her crew, there was a period of mass investigation led by the Terra Gov Marine Core. At the time, war with the Lizard Folk had barely ended, and both parties were on edge at the time, fearful that the other would pull a turnaround and break the treaty. The resulting catastrophe could result in the annihalation of the other's forces, or worse, both forces at once.

Hyper Star System 2533 was promptly probed discretely for a set of years, and the lost transmission was formally brushed away as a conspiracy by TerraGov. They had erased all personal information of the late McBartelone and his bethrothed ship. Unfortunately it did not succeed. It had the opposite effect even, resulting in the boom of the adventurous venturing out to Hyper Star 2533 to investigate the incident themselves.

Regardless of it all, it failed, for the next 50 years the tale had become an urban myth, forgotten. This miserable incident was finally written off as a Captain's miserable dramatic misinterpretation of flying into a cloud of radioactive material, or worse, into a dimmed dwarf star. The people forgot, hell, even TerraGov had forgotten the tale of the missing Captain. In the end, it was simply written off as a stain on TerraGov's reputation.

That is until a TGMC warship recieved a transmission from McBartelone once more.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The year is 2506 in the bleak edges of the Lodossian Solar System came a visitor to the puny TerraGov Marine Warship. Or in a better sense, a traveller revealed itself to _it's_ visitors.

A clear blotch in the stars slowly began to tear away and a pale glistening drop of silver had began to manifest over the stars with an almost incandescent arrogance. This process began slowly and would take many hours, but that wasn't the only visitor to the Marines. A ship was headed in the direction of the warship from the general direction of the slowly revealing pearl. The commanding office of the warship attempted to establish contact with the unknown ship. And the ship gave its credentials.

S.S. Lunamore V.

This name danced on the lips of the onlookers in the commander's cockpit, no one could believe it. S.S. Lunamore IV, a research ship that had lost itself to the stars. A rather old and outdated ship, last of its kind even. There was not meant to be another Lunamore after the fourth, and yet. An unforgettable encounter that would rock TerraGov and Nanotrasen had arrived.

It was a marvelous ship. The hull, a once dated barely functioning metal brick had it's old plating replaced with sleek weapons grade plastic fashioned into a marvelous sturdy looking tube. The thrusters which once carried arrogant men across the stars were now lacking, and in their place were a glorious collection of sleek ropes, each one blazing at the end while they span in unison to propel the cockpit. The cockpit, oh the cockpit. What was once a metal coffin fitting a crew of 5 behind a thin piece of pathetic glass had been reimagined into a beautiful 20-sided structure, each side was a flat triangular panel of an unknown crystalline structure. Each triangle glowed marvelously, each a color unlike the others, as it got closer to the bewitched men they could see that each panel was actually the side of a triangular pyramid that bled inward towards the center. Each prism was a marvelous light that seemed to bring unnecessary yet well deserved attention to the cockpit. There were those that in its glory stared too long they had to look away. And in their after image of the lights, they saw that inside the prisms was none other than a humanoid figure.

It was a marvel to behold. Captain Payan had been staring at the object with an enchanted stupor, and his superior, Major Windhealer was the first to break past his peers.

"Rainbow spirit of the sky, Grand Chief Windhealer greets you. What is the name of your tribe?"

"We come in peace," Responded the voice in a crackling static stained voice, "you might no recognize me anymore, but do you recall a... _Plutonius Mcbartelone_?"

A few seconds transpired and the command room was tainted with a pertinent silence. They all wanted to ask it, but the ambience preceded them.

 Windhealer riposted. "Our radio breaks. Please, join us so that we may celebrate your return and conquest of the pearl in the sky." 

Upon lifting his finger off the radio button, he and his staff were the first to witness the beauty of the new ship. The sleek ropes that propelled it latched onto the plating surrounding the outside of the hanger,and the end of the tube shaped hull connected perfectly with the hangar entrance. Then, what was thought as the outer hull of the hull peeled itself to cover the 20-sided cockpit, revealing its treasure.

The tube was adorned with transparent orbs that glowed faintly and beautifully. When the onlookers inspected more closely, they saw that some of the orbs had faces on them.

Then, flashes of brilliant neon lights slid from the cockpit end of the tube to the hangar end. And at the hangar the men and women of the TerraGov Marine Core met the beauty, the light, the Ethereals. 

Major Windhealer was the first to step forward. He bore witness to the one in front.

Standing tall and glowing a faint white, the recently found Captain McBartelone stepped forward. He faced Windhealer and opened his mouth, "Hello. You may remember me as a great Captain of the Marine Core but that is no more." As he spoke his voice cracked and cackled like one's would if they were talking through an old barely functional radio. Windhealer silently scanned his eyes on the old Captain, still in his Uniform, seemingly untouched by time.

"I died long ago, and reborn anew, thanks to the glory of the great mother. My name is now Plutonium I, and as decree of the mother we've been sent here bearing gifts and new acquaintences. Some reborn. Some _new_." 

He gestured at the small party of silent incandescent humanoids. 

"The mother she wishes to understand the limitations of this form. Won't you please have us as a guest along side you...humans?"

Before Windhealer could answer, one of the glowing folk walked forward with one of the crystaline orbs. Her face bore a simple blank expression, one unknowing of anything else. She placed the orb on the floor and _POP_.

The crystal's contents did not spill like the liquid it should have. Instead, the cohesive gray droplet slowly bounced towards the Major and a cute unwarranted face formed to look up at him. 

The first Slime.

A clear blotch in the stars had slowly began to tear away and a pale glistening drop of silver had began to manifest over the stars with grand incandescent arrogance.

S.S. Lunamore V.

This was the name that escaped the lips of the onlookers in the commander's cockpit, no one could believe it. S.S. Lunamore IV, a research ship that had lost itself to the stars. A rather old and outdated ship. It came visiting the war craft and from its communication devices came a promise of an unforgettable reencounter. It was a marvelous ship. The hull that was once a dated barely functioning metal brick had it's old plating had been replaced with sleek weapons grade plastic and was fashioned into a marvelous sturdy looking tube. The thrusters which once carried arrogant men across the stars were now lacking, but in their place were a glorious collection of ropes, each blazing at the end while they span in unison to propel the cockpit. The cockpit, oh the cockpit. What was once a metal coffin fitting a crew of 5 cramped men behind a thin piece of pathetic glass had been reimagined into a beautiful 20-sided structure, each side being a flat triangular panel of an unknown crystalline structure. Each triangle glowed marvelously, each a color unlike the others, as it got closer to the bewitched men they could see that each panel had a tube growing inwards. Each tube was a marvelous light that seemed to bring unnecessary attention to the cockpit. There were those that in its glory stared too long they had to look away. And in their after image of the lights, they saw that in the center of each tube, was a humanoid figure.
